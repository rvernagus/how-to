I was excited to learn Lua so I could make games
with the LÃ¶ve 2D game engine. That's the why.

I started with BlackBulletIV's Lua for programmers.
Next I read the official Programming in Lua book.
That's the how.

It might be helpful to check out the Lua short
reference on lua-users.org.

The main topics not covered are standard libraries:
 * string library
 * table library
 * math library
 * io library
 * os library

By the way, this entire file is valid Lua; save it
as learn.lua and run it with "lua learn.lua" !

This was first written for tylerneylon.com. It's
also available as a github gist. Tutorials for other
languages, in the same style as this one, are here:

Have fun with Lua!
